Files ending in .PAS are for Pascal or Turbo Pascal. Files ending in 
.C are for any ANSI C compiler (I use Borland C++). Files ending in
.CPP are for ANSI C++. Files ending in .BAS are for MS-DOS BASIC.
Files ending in .TXT contain pseudo code algorithms. Here's an
inventory of this month's files:

    powex.cpp       Power function in C++
    powex.ide       Borland C++ 4.0 project file
    powex.txt       Power function in pseudo Pascal

Compile the program with Borland C++ 4.0 or an ANSI C++ compiler that
implements exceptions. From MS-DOS, enter:

    bcc powex

Or, you may compile and run the example in the Borland C++ 4.0 IDE as
an EasyWin application. Use the Project menu to open POWEX.IDE and
press Ctrl+F9 to compile and run. You might have to modify the
project's pathnames if you did not install Borland C++ in C:\BC4.

For more information about the files, see my column "Algorithm Alley"
appearing regularly in Dr. Dobb's Journal. Enjoy!
